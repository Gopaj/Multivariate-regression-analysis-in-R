# Multivariate-regression-analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyse and then predict the protein and moist content using the wheat.RData dataset.

This was done using R for coding the regression models, and the code is written in an R markdown file called analysis code.rmd. 

The knitted output of the markdown file can be seen in the analysis report.html.
